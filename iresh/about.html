<h2 class="text-center">WE ARE IRESH</h2>
<p>Iresh was formed in 2020 with the idea of supporting unique, distinct, and pioneering designs in apparel and accessories. We started as a humble marketing platform that brought in innovative sustainable clothing techniques which allowed us to introduce quirky, subtle, and printed products in various niches and themes promoting sustainability. Soon our love for a sustainable living went further and we started promoting craftspersons and local producers. Being passionate fashion technology students, we were able to identify the shortcomings of conventional products available in the market and decided to take the matter into our hands. It was before the pandemic that we realized the need for sustainable clothing and that’s when we ventured into Iresh- rendering sustain.</p>

<p>This is our story. It’s not much but we will soon update this page with insights into what made Iresh the global platform that it has become today. Stay tuned!</p>
